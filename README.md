## Maximilian Hvesser-Lewis Resume

This CV/resume template is created using [Typst](https://typst.app), and this repository serves both as an evolving record of my personal resume and as a template for anyone who wants to create a similar document.

As a newcomer to Typst, I cannot guarantee that this template is a perfect example of best practices, but I am pleased with the current result. Over time, I will continue to refine the codebase and enhance the overall appearance of the resume.
