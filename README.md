## Maxhves resume

This CV/resume template is written using [Typst](https://typst.app) and this repository serves as an iterative store of my personal resume and as a template for others whom might like to recreate a document similar to mine.

Being new to Typst myself, I cannot promise that this template serves as a pinacle representation of how/what to do, but I am satisfied with the output and over time I will improve the codebase and look of the resume in general.
